    "## 1.6 Homework\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this homework is to train a simple model for predicting the duration of a ride - similar to what we did in this module.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q2. Computing duration\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's compute the `duration` variable. It should contain the duration of a ride in minutes. \n",
    "\n",
    "What's the average trip duration in January?\n",
    "\n",
    "* 15.16\n",
    "* 19.16\n",
    "* 24.16\n",
    "* 29.16\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "Check the distribution of the duration variable. There are some outliers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's remove them and keep only the records where the duration was between 1 and 60 minutes (inclusive).\n",
    "\n",
    "How many records did you drop? \n",
    "\n",
    "## Q3. Missing values\n",
    "\n",
    "The features we'll use for our model are the pickup and dropoff location IDs. \n",
    "\n",
    "But they have a lot of missing values there. Let's replace them with \"-1\".\n",
    "\n",
    "What's the fractions of missing values for the pickup location ID? I.e. fraction of \"-1\"s after you filled the NAs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* 53%\n",
    "* 63%\n",
    "* 73%\n",
    "* 83%\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q4. One-hot encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's apply one-hot encoding to the pickup and dropoff location IDs. We'll use only these two features for our model. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Turn the dataframe into a list of dictionaries\n",
    "* Fit a dictionary vectorizer \n",
    "* Get a feature matrix from it\n",
    "\n",
    "What's the dimensionality of this matrix? (The number of columns).\n",
    "\n",
    "* 2\n",
    "* 152\n",
    "* 352\n",
    "* 525\n",
    "* 725\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q5. Training a model\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's use the feature matrix from the previous step to train a model. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Train a plain linear regression model with default parameters \n",
    "* Calculate the RMSE of the model on the training data\n",
    "\n",
    "What's the RMSE on train?\n",
    "\n",
    "* 5.52\n",
    "* 10.52\n",
    "* 15.52\n",
    "* 20.52\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q6. Evaluating the model\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's apply this model to the validation dataset (Feb 2021). \n",
    "\n",
    "What's the RMSE on validation?\n",
    "\n",
    "* 6.01\n",
    "* 11.01\n",
    "* 16.01\n",
    "* 21.01\n",
